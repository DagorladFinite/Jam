Click on poeple to kill them and gather their blood. You can buy upgrades in the shop, so you get bonuses such as blood/s or more blood per kill among others.
Once you've killed some people you can judge them to get rewards, go to the purgatory and either click on the heaven or hell button to send them there according to your criteria.

You are the lord of hell and have some spare time. Go hunt some humans and take their blood. With their blood you will be able to augment your demonic powers!
From increasing the blood flux released from your victims or spread infectious diseases that will instantly kill people, you will have a range of powerful abilities 
that will help you unleash your fury!!
With the souls from the bodies collected, you will be able to dictate judgement upon them and choose wether they go to the boring ol' heaven or you bring them to your sweet 
realm of pain and destruction.
Everything you do correctly will give you bonuses in your blood collection making you more and more powerful. Gain rare achievments and enjoy the sweet feeling of being
the most powerful being under the ground.
